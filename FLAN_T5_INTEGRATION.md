# 🤖 Flan-T5 LLM Integration - Natural Language Guidance

## Overview

MyVision now includes **Google's Flan-T5** language model for generating polite, natural, and context-aware voice guidance for visually impaired users. This AI-powered enhancement makes the system more human-like and helpful.

---

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **AI-Powered Voice Descriptions**
- Uses Flan-T5 to convert technical detection data into natural, polite sentences
- Generates context-aware guidance based on road safety conditions
- Provides directional information (left, right, ahead, etc.)

### 2. **Safety Assessment**
- Automatically evaluates if it's safe to cross the road
- Considers:
  - Traffic light status (red/green/yellow)
  - Proximity of vehicles
  - Presence of pedestrians
  - Zebra crossing locations

### 3. **Proximity & Direction Detection**
- Calculates object distance using bounding box dimensions
- Determines object direction in 5 zones:
  - Far left
  - Left
  - Ahead (center)
  - Right
  - Far right

### 4. **Smart Object Summarization**
- Groups multiple objects (e.g., "3 cars, 2 people")
- Prioritizes important objects for safety
- Provides concise, actionable information

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Model Information
- **Model**: `google/flan-t5-small`
- **Size**: 308MB (one-time download)
- **Purpose**: Text generation for natural language descriptions
- **Framework**: Hugging Face Transformers

### Helper Functions

#### 1. `get_proximity(box)`
```python
def get_proximity(box: List[float]) -> float:
    """Calculate proximity based on bounding box height"""
    return box[3] - box[1]  # y2 - y1
```

#### 2. `get_direction(box, frame_width)`
```python
def get_direction(box: List[float], frame_width: int) -> str:
    """Estimate direction in 5 zones"""
    x_center = (box[0] + box[2]) / 2
    # Returns: "from far left", "from your left", "ahead of you", etc.
```

#### 3. `check_safety(detections, frame_height)`
```python
def check_safety(detections: Dict, frame_height: int) -> bool:
    """Determine if it's safe to cross the road"""
    # Checks traffic lights, nearby cars, and pedestrians
    # Returns True if safe, False otherwise
```

#### 4. `generate_polite_text(base_instruction, tokenizer, llm_model)`
```python
def generate_polite_text(base_instruction: str, ...) -> str:
    """Use Flan-T5 to make instructions polite and natural"""
    prompt = f"Convert this instruction into a polite, natural sentence: {base_instruction}"
    # Returns: Natural, polite version
```

## 📊 Example Output

### Before (Template-based):
```
"I see 2 cars, 1 person. Red traffic light ahead, please stop."
```

### After (AI-powered with Flan-T5):
```
"There are 2 cars and 1 person approaching. It would be safest to 
wait at this time. Note: Car from your left."
```

```
"The light is green and the path is clear. You may safely cross 
the road now."
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Automatic Mode
The system automatically uses Flan-T5 if loaded:
- ✅ **LLM Available**: Uses AI-powered natural language generation
- ⚠️ **LLM Not Available**: Falls back to template-based descriptions

### API Endpoints
All existing endpoints now benefit from AI-powered descriptions:
- `POST /api/detect` (unified endpoint)
- `POST /api/detect/image`
- `POST /api/detect/video`
- `WS /api/detect/live`

### Example API Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "type": "image",
  "voice_description": "There are 2 cars approaching from your right. Please wait until it is safe. The traffic light is red, so please stop and wait.",
  "detections": { ... },
  "counts": { ... }
}
```

## 🎯 Safety Logic

### Road Crossing Decision Tree

```
Is there a GREEN light?
  ├── YES → Are there cars/people nearby?
  │           ├── YES → ❌ NOT SAFE (wait)
  │           └── NO  → ✅ SAFE (can cross)
  └── NO → ❌ NOT SAFE (wait)
```

### Proximity Threshold
- Objects with bounding box height > 20% of frame height are considered "close"
- Closer objects trigger safety warnings

---

## 📦 Dependencies Added

```txt
transformers>=4.30.0   # Hugging Face Transformers library
sentencepiece>=0.1.99  # Tokenizer for Flan-T5
```

### Installation
```bash
pip install transformers sentencepiece
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Model Loading
Models are loaded at server startup:
```python
# backend/main.py - ModelManager class
self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-small")
self.llm_model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("google/flan-t5-small")
```

### First-Time Setup
- **Initial Download**: ~308MB (one-time)
- **Cache Location**: `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`
- **Load Time**: ~3-5 minutes (first time), ~10 seconds (subsequent)

---

## 🔄 Fallback Mechanism

If Flan-T5 fails to load:
- System automatically falls back to template-based descriptions
- All functionality continues to work
- Warning message appears in logs: `"⚠️ Flan-T5 model not loaded"`

---

## 🎤 Voice Description Examples

### Scenario 1: Safe to Cross
**Detection**: Green light, no nearby vehicles
**AI Output**: 
> "The traffic light is green and there are no vehicles nearby. You may safely cross the road now."

### Scenario 2: Unsafe - Cars Approaching
**Detection**: Red light, 2 cars nearby
**AI Output**:
> "There are 2 cars approaching from your right. The traffic light is red. Please wait until it is safe to proceed."

### Scenario 3: Pedestrian Crossing
**Detection**: Zebra crossing detected
**AI Output**:
> "A zebra crossing is detected ahead of you. When the light turns green and it's clear, you may use it to cross safely."

### Scenario 4: Multiple Objects
**Detection**: 3 cars, 2 people, 1 bicycle
**AI Output**:
> "I can see 3 cars, 2 people, and 1 bicycle in the area. Please wait for a safe moment to cross. Note: Car from your left."

```bash
# Clear cache and retry
rm -rf ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--google--flan-t5-small
# Restart server
```

### Slow Generation
- First generation is slower (model initialization)
- Subsequent generations are fast (~100ms)
- Consider using GPU if available

### Memory Issues
- Flan-T5-small uses ~1GB RAM
- For lower memory, disable LLM (uses template fallback)
- Larger models (base/large) require more RAM
