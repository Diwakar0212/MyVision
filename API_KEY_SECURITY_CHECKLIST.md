# 🚨 URGENT: API Key Security Breach - Action Checklist

## ✅ Immediate Actions (Do These NOW!)

### 1. **Revoke the Exposed API Key** ⏰ URGENT
- [ ] Go to: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- [ ] Find and DELETE this key: `AIzaSyBIN3jVecrb1t0xLWtEtAVtdOpcaTQjkoY`
- [ ] Confirm deletion

### 2. **Generate New API Key**
- [ ] In Google AI Studio, click "Create API Key"
- [ ] Copy the new key (save it temporarily)
- [ ] **DO NOT** share or commit this key!

### 3. **Set Up Local Environment**
- [ ] Navigate to backend folder: `cd backend`
- [ ] Copy template: `cp .env.example .env` (or manually create `.env`)
- [ ] Edit `.env` file and paste your NEW key:
  ```
  GEMINI_API_KEY=your-new-key-here
  ```
- [ ] Save and close the file

### 4. **Install python-dotenv**
```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

### 5. **Test the Setup**
```bash
cd backend
python -c "import os; from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv(); print('✅ Key loaded!' if os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY') else '❌ Key NOT found!')"
```

### 6. **Start Backend with New Key**
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

You should see:
- ✅ No warnings about missing GEMINI_API_KEY
- ✅ "Gemini AI model loaded successfully!"

---

## 🔐 What Was Fixed

✅ **Removed hardcoded API key** from `backend/main.py`
✅ **Added environment variable support** with python-dotenv
✅ **Created `.env.example`** template file
✅ **Updated `.gitignore`** to exclude `.env` files (prevents future leaks)
✅ **Added `SECURITY.md`**  with comprehensive security guide
✅ **Committed and pushed** fixes to GitHub

---

## ⚠️ Why This Matters

Your API key was **publicly visible** on GitHub, which means:
- Anyone could use your key
- You could be charged for their usage
- Your quota could be exhausted
- Potential security breach

**The old key MUST be revoked immediately!**

---

## 📝 Next Steps (After Completing Above)

### Check for Unauthorized Usage
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Check API usage metrics
3. Look for unusual activity
4. Set up billing alerts

### Set API Restrictions (Recommended)
1. In Google Cloud Console
2. Navigate to API Keys
3. Add restrictions:
   - API restrictions (Gemini API only)
   - Application restrictions (optional)

### Update Documentation
- [x] README.md already mentions environment variables
- [x] SECURITY.md created with full guide
- [ ] Optional: Add setup video/screenshots

## 🎯 Current Status

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Code Fixed | ✅ Committed to GitHub |
| Old Key Revoked | ⏰ **ACTION REQUIRED** |
| New Key Generated | ⏰ **ACTION REQUIRED** |
| .env File Created | ⏰ **ACTION REQUIRED** |
| Backend Tested | ⏰ **ACTION REQUIRED** |

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Never commit .env files** - They're already in .gitignore
2. **Use different keys** for dev/prod environments
3. **Rotate keys regularly** (every 3-6 months)
4. **Monitor usage** in Google Cloud Console
5. **Set billing alerts** to catch unusual activity

---

## ❓ Need Help?

If you see any errors:
1. Check `SECURITY.md` for detailed instructions
2. Verify `.env` file is in `backend/` folder
3. Ensure python-dotenv is installed
4. Check environment variable is loaded (see test command above)

---

## ✅ Verification

After completing all steps, run:
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

Expected output:
```
==================================================
🚀 Starting MyVision API Server
==================================================
🔄 Loading YOLOv8m model...
✅ YOLOv8m model loaded.
...
✅ Gemini AI model loaded successfully!
   🎯 Advanced voice intelligence enabled!
==================================================
```

If you see "⚠️ WARNING: GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable not set!" - your .env file isn't loaded correctly.

---

**Remember**: The most important step is **REVOKING THE OLD KEY**! Do this first before anything else.
