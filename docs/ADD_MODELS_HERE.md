# ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED: Add Your Trained Models

## Current Status

✅ **Server is RUNNING** at http://localhost:8000  
✅ **YOLOv8m model** - Downloaded and loaded successfully!  
❌ **Traffic Lights model** - MISSING  
❌ **Zebra Crossing model** - MISSING  

---

## 🚨 What You Need to Do

You need to add your **2 custom trained models** to the backend:

### Required Models:
1. **`traffic_lights.pt`** - Your traffic light detection model
2. **`zebra_crossing.pt`** - Your zebra crossing detection model

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Download Models from Google Colab

If your models are in Google Colab:

```python
# In your Colab notebook, download the models
from google.colab import files

# Download traffic lights model
files.download('traffic_lights.pt')

# Download zebra crossing model
files.download('zebra_crossing.pt')
```

### Step 2: Copy Models to Backend Folder

Copy both files to this exact location:
```
C:\Users\diwakar\Downloads\syn-vision-main (1)\syn-vision-main\backend\models\
```

**Final structure should be:**
```
backend\models\
├── yolov8m.pt              ✅ (Already downloaded)
├── traffic_lights.pt       ❌ (You need to add this)
└── zebra_crossing.pt       ❌ (You need to add this)
```

### Step 3: Restart the Server

After copying the models:

1. **Stop the current server**: Press `CTRL+C` in the terminal where server is running
2. **Start again**:
   ```powershell
   python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

---

## ✅ How to Verify

After restarting, you should see:
```
🔄 Loading YOLOv8m model...
✅ YOLOv8m model loaded.
🔄 Loading Traffic Light model...
✅ Traffic Light model loaded.
🔄 Loading Zebra Crossing model...
✅ Zebra Crossing model loaded.
✅ All models loaded successfully!
```

Then test:
```powershell
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "models": {
    "yolov8m": true,
    "traffic_lights": true,
    "zebra_crossing": true
  }
}
```

---

## 🎯 Alternative: Use Placeholder Models (For Testing)

If you don't have the trained models yet, you can temporarily use YOLOv8 for all three:

```powershell
cd backend\models
copy yolov8m.pt traffic_lights.pt
copy yolov8m.pt zebra_crossing.pt
```

⚠️ **Warning**: This won't give accurate results for traffic lights and zebra crossings, but it will allow you to test the API!

---

## 🧪 Testing the API

### 1. Check API Documentation
Visit: http://localhost:8000/docs

### 2. Test with an Image
```powershell
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/detect" `
  -F "file=@path\to\your\image.jpg" `
  -F "confidence=0.5"
```

### 3. Test with a Video
```powershell
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/detect" `
  -F "file=@path\to\your\video.mp4" `
  -F "confidence=0.4" `
  -F "sample_rate=5"
```

### 4. Use the Test Script
```powershell
python test_api.py
```

## 📞 Current Server Info

- **Status**: Running
- **URL**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

### Current Health Status:
```json
{
  "status": "models_not_loaded",
  "models": {
    "yolov8m": true,         ✅
    "traffic_lights": false, ❌ ADD THIS
    "zebra_crossing": false  ❌ ADD THIS
  }
}
```

---

## 🎉 Once All Models Are Added

You'll be able to:

✅ Upload images and get annotated results with all detections  
✅ Upload videos and get fully annotated videos  
✅ Detect traffic lights (red/green/yellow)  
✅ Detect zebra crossings  
✅ Detect 80+ object types (cars, people, bikes, etc.)  
✅ Get voice descriptions for vision assistance

## 🆘 Need Help?

### If you can't find your models:
- Check your Colab notebook's Files panel
- Check your Downloads folder
- Re-run the training cells in Colab

### If models won't load:
- Ensure files are named exactly: `traffic_lights.pt` and `zebra_crossing.pt`
- Ensure files are in the correct folder
- Check file isn't corrupted (should be several MB in size)

### Quick test if you're stuck:
Use placeholder models (copy yolov8m.pt) just to test the API functionality!

**Your server is ready and waiting for the models! 🚀**
